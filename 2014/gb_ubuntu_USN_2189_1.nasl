de Mooij, Jesse Ruderman, Nathan Froyd and Christian Holler discovered multiple
memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening
a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could
potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application
crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1518)

Abhishek Arya discovered an out of bounds read when decoding JPG images.
An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service
via application crash. (CVE-2014-1523)

Abhishek Arya discovered a buffer overflow when a script uses a non-XBL
object as an XBL object. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker
could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1524)

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that sites with notification permissions can
run script in a privileged context in some circumstances. If a user had
enabled scripting, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1529)

It was discovered that browser history navigations could be used to load
a site with the addressbar displaying the wrong address. If a user had
enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct
cross-site scripting or phishing attacks. (CVE-2014-1530)

A use-after-free was discovered when resizing images in some
circumstances. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could
potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application
crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking
Thunderbird. (CVE-2014-1531)

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a use-after-free during
host resolution in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially
exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
